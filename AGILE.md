# start which some explanations of how you used JIRA i.e. priority as must have - nice to have


My first sprint was a short one, intended to get familiar with JIRA and get the initial app set up and deployed. 
* I set a time limit from 23:40 on 04/02 until 02:00 05/02.
* There were five tasks each with one story point. 
* During the last stage of the sprint, I  had some issues with getting the app to display via Heroku and realise I had underestimated the story points on this task.
*I finished the sprint ahead of time at 01:40 05/02

sprint 2 notes:
* decided to set sprints to one week at a time
* decided the API was going to slow me down to much so lowered the priority for this sprint.
* Decided to build out the site structure with the backup plan of user posting jobs for others to view
* Due to the change in tactic I was adding user stories as I go which would be bad if working as part of a team. My next sprint I will take extra care to plan tasks out ahead of the sprint initialization.
* This sprint has felt chaotic and disorganized partly becaus eI am still learning how to structure a project whilst at the same time mastering a new framework. After reading [this article on writing good user stories](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/as-a-developer-is-not-a-user-story/) I changed all user stories with the developer as the user to developers tasks and I believe this with better pre planning of a sprint will assist me moving forward to be more organized.
* to many must haves due to poor forward planning
