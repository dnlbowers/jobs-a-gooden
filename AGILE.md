# start which some explanations of how you used JIRA i.e. priority as must have - nice to have

## Sprint 1 notes:
My first sprint was a short one, intended to get familiar with JIRA and get the initial app set up and deployed. 
* I set a time limit from 23:40 on 04/02 until 02:00 05/02.
* There were five tasks each with one story point. 
* During the last stage of the sprint, I  had some issues with getting the app to display via Heroku and realise I had underestimated the story points on this task.
*I finished the sprint ahead of time at 01:40 05/02

## Sprint 2 notes:
* decided to set sprints to one week at a time
* decided the API was going to slow me down to much so lowered the priority for this sprint.
* Decided to build out the site structure with the backup plan of user posting jobs for others to view
* Due to the change in tactic I was adding user stories as I go which would be bad if working as part of a team. My next sprint I will take extra care to plan tasks out ahead of the sprint initialization.
* This sprint has felt chaotic and disorganized partly becaus eI am still learning how to structure a project whilst at the same time mastering a new framework. After reading [this article on writing good user stories](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/as-a-developer-is-not-a-user-story/) I changed all user stories with the developer as the user to "developers tasks" and I believe this with better pre planning of a sprint will assist me moving forward to be more organized.
* To many must haves due to poor forward planning.
* After concluding the sprint, I believe that a lot of the issue I was having using agile development were due to my planning not being thorough enough, and a lack of understanding of some of the key concepts required to work with datamodels within django. I have resolved to go back into the research and planning stage in order to gain further clarity before the third sprint. This will be done by drafting the features in my readme to further clarify and drill down on the MVP. My hope here is it will help me follow the above referenced article to write better user stories for my sprit so all sprint tasks are set solely to provide relevant value to the user.

## Sprint 3 notes:
* Due to the time taken to plan between sprint 2 and 3 this sprint felt a lot smoother. 
* My burn down chart reflects a down wards trend, however I over committed with the amount of user stories added at the sprint set up phase. The issue here is not knowing exactly when I will have time to work on the project and so I have no way of accurately predicting how many stories I will be able to complete.
* To combat this I may refined my "must haves", "should haves" etc each sprint and ensure I only work on the highest priority ones each time as I did with sprint 3.

## Sprint 4 notes:
* Since in sprint 3 I managed to complete 6 user stories I chose to take all the remaining seven into sprint 4.
* Due to several commitments outside of the course I only completed one task. This was the first week I have not had much time to work on the project due to haven't a tech interview questionnaire to complete.
* Due to the above this turned more into a dummy sprint with little achieved. Up until I had to divert my attention the burn down chart was looking ok so I will be re-adding the stories to the next sprint with reassessed priorities.

## Sprint 5 notes:
* I re-added all the user stories to this sprint but underestimated the amount of time required to implement the pin job feature. As a result I only managed to get two stories done in this sprint.
* I allowed myself to run over on this sprint whilst I completed the Pin job feature, although concluded the task with a bug and created a bug ticket to enter the next sprint

## Sprint 6 notes:
* I realized that I concluded PJG-29 prematurely. And had to reopen this story to create the view and page for the user specific pinned jobs list.
* I concluded this sprint with just 3 tasks left to create the core functionality of my MVP. 
* I realized that the periods between sprints is useful for reflection on current progress and have realized some further stories to be added to the back log.
    * Add job post.
    * Display insights chronologically.
    * Note/insight deletion.
    * Bug tickets added for issues found with user stories implemented during the previous sprints
* Still trying to get the hang of story points and my velocity rate. I feel this will improve as I become more familiar with the framework. 
* Beginning to rethink a profile page as it seems unnecessary at this point in the process.

## Sprint 7 notes:
* First time my burn down chart met with the expected trajectory largely due to having a limit number of user stories.
* Realized my mistake of meeting the criteria of 60% must haves in a sprint. I was planning with 60% of the tasks and not 60% of the over all story points. This will be fixed from the next sprint onwards.
* Decided to keep the job list page as the home page (initially this was only a temporary measure) However in the course of development I decided that a hero image would look good below the nave bar and decided to make this from my carousel picturing the sites features.
* Since the idea of a user profile seemed to be less relevant at this stage the last day of sprint seven was used to plan further user stories to plan the next stages of development in a way that provided the most value to the user.

## Sprint 8 notes: 
* I have added several user stories so that all tasks are aimed at adding value to the user
* Learning from my mistake in the previous sprint I have assign 60% of the story points as "must haves" for this sprint as opposed to 60% of the tasks.
* Burn down chart was looking good until PJG-49 where I got stuck understanding how to utilize messages in django. I started to make progress when the sprint concluded mid task. This will be come the first task of the next sprint to complete the JS to close the alerts, and implement models.

## Sprint 9 notes: 
* 60% of the story points was more or less all of the stories due to the last item in the sprint which was the final over hall of the front end design.
* This sprint is aiming to conclude with all functionality in tact (or conclude very near to it).
* I will be noting down design thoughts and ideas as I go to implement later during PJG-53.
* sprint finished part way through PJG-53, This story will be past into the next sprint.

## Sprint 10 notes: 
* There are slightly more than 60% of story point as must haves because I need to ensure the bugs which cannot be considered features are solved.
* This sprint is aimed at having the site ready in production so it is ready for release. There is much more I would like to have done however as in the real world there are deadlines, this project to is running out of time before submission. I am treating this as the first release and will continue to improve as we go.
* Finished this sprint 2 days early due to all tasks completed. All though this was finished early it was a harder sprint due to a large story of 40 points, in future I would break this story down into sub tasks to help stay more focused whilst styling the front end.
