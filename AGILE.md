My first sprint was a short one, intended to get familiar with JIRA and get the initial app set up and deployed. 
* I set a time limit from 23:40 on 04/02 until 02:00 05/02.
* There were five tasks each with one story point. 
* During the last stage of the sprint, I  had some issues with getting the app to display via Heroku and realise I had underestimated the story points on this task.
*I finished the sprint ahead of time at 01:40 05/02
