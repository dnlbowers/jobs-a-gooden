# start which some explanations of how you used JIRA i.e. priority as must have - nice to have

## Sprint 1 notes:
My first sprint was a short one, intended to get familiar with JIRA and get the initial app set up and deployed. 
* I set a time limit from 23:40 on 04/02 until 02:00 05/02.
* There were five tasks each with one story point. 
* During the last stage of the sprint, I  had some issues with getting the app to display via Heroku and realise I had underestimated the story points on this task.
*I finished the sprint ahead of time at 01:40 05/02

## Sprint 2 notes:
* decided to set sprints to one week at a time
* decided the API was going to slow me down to much so lowered the priority for this sprint.
* Decided to build out the site structure with the backup plan of user posting jobs for others to view
* Due to the change in tactic I was adding user stories as I go which would be bad if working as part of a team. My next sprint I will take extra care to plan tasks out ahead of the sprint initialization.
* This sprint has felt chaotic and disorganized partly becaus eI am still learning how to structure a project whilst at the same time mastering a new framework. After reading [this article on writing good user stories](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/as-a-developer-is-not-a-user-story/) I changed all user stories with the developer as the user to "developers tasks" and I believe this with better pre planning of a sprint will assist me moving forward to be more organized.
* To many must haves due to poor forward planning.
* After concluding the sprint, I believe that a lot of the issue I was having using agile development were due to my planning not being thorough enough, and a lack of understanding of some of the key concepts required to work with datamodels within django. I have resolved to go back into the research and planning stage in order to gain further clarity before the third sprint. This will be done by drafting the features in my readme to further clarify and drill down on the MVP. My hope here is it will help me follow the above referenced article to write better user stories for my sprit so all sprint tasks are set solely to provide relevant value to the user.

## Sprint 3 notes:
* Due to the time taken to plan between sprint 2 and 3 this sprint felt a lot smoother. 
* My burn down chart reflects a down wards trend, however I over committed with the amount of user stories added at the sprint set up phase. The issue here is not knowing exactly when I will have time to work on the project and so I have no way of accurately predicting how many stories I will be able to complete.
* To combat this I may refined my "must haves", "should haves" etc each sprint and ensure I only work on the highest priority ones each time as I did with sprint 3.

## Sprint 4 notes:
* Since in sprint 3 I managed to complete 6 user stories I chose to take all the remaining seven into sprint 4.
* Due to several commitments outside of the course I only completed one task. This was the first week I have not had much time to work on the project due to haven't a tech interview questionnaire to complete.
* Due to the above this turned more into a dummy sprint with little achieved. Up until I had to divert my attention the burn down chart was looking ok so I will be re-adding the stories to the next sprint with reassessed priorities.

## Sprint 5 notes:
* I re-added all the user stories to this sprint but underestimated the amount of time required to implement the pin job feature. As a result I only managed to get two stories done in this sprint.
* I allowed myself to run over on this sprint whilst I completed the Pin job feature, although concluded the task with a bug and created a bug ticket to enter the next sprint
