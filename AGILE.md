My first sprint was a short one, intended to get familiar with JIRA and get the initial app set up and deployed. 
* I set a time limit from 23:40 on 04/02 until 02:00 05/02.
* There were five tasks each with one story point. 
* During the last stage of the sprint, I  had some issues with getting the app to display via Heroku and realise I had underestimated the story points on this task.
*I finished the sprint ahead of time at 01:40 05/02

sprint 2 notes:
* decided to set sprints to one week at a time
* decided the API was going to slow me down to much so lowered the priority for this sprint.
* Decided to build out the site structure with the backup plan of user posting jobs for others to view
* due to the change in tactic I was adding user stories as I go which would be bad if working as part of a team. My next sprint I will take extra care to plan tasks out ahead of the sprint initialisation
